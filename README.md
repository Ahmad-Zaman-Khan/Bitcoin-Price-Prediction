## Introduction
This project focuses on utilizing LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to model and forecast Bitcoin prices based on historical data. LSTM networks are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies, making them a powerful tool for time series prediction tasks.

## Requirements

* [Python] 3.10
* matplotlib==3.8.2
* numpy==1.26.2
* pandas==2.1.3
* scikit_learn==1.3.2
* tensorflow==2.15.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

     `git clone https://github.com/Ahmad-Zaman-Khan/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    `cd Bitcoin-Price-Prediction`

3. Install dependencies:
  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Data Preparation:
  * Place your historical Bitcoin price data in the data/ directory.
2. Model Training:
  * Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to train the LSTM model.
3. Prediction:
  * Utilize the trained model to make Bitcoin price predictions.
